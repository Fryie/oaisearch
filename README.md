# OAI Search Interface
This is a simple proof-of-concept web interface for an [*elasticsearch*](http://www.elasticsearch.org) database of OAI (Open Archives Initiative) publication data.

It requires that elasticsearch be running on localhost and listening on port 9200.

Currently it only supports searching in the "contents" field; more flexibility should be trivial to implement.
